This is my lab1 simple calculator folder.

In this lab 1, I split the calculator into three classes based on functional responsibilities:
1. Calculator -- handles calculation logic.
2. InputHandler -- Manages user input, including the exit command.
3. OutputHandler -- Handles console output, such as displaying results, errors, and messages.
